### Chapter 1: Introduction  
This chapter provides an overview of the "Book Manager" project, its purpose, and its significance.  

#### 1.1 Introduction  
"Book Manager" is a web-based application designed to streamline library operations, including managing books, borrowers, transactions, reservations, and reviews. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MySQL, it addresses the inefficiencies of manual library systems by offering a digital, user-friendly solution.  

#### 1.2 Motivation  
The project was inspired by the need to apply database management and web development skills learned in CSE312. Manual library processes are time-consuming and error-prone, motivating us to create an automated system that enhances efficiency and provides practical experience in full-stack development.  

#### 1.3 Objectives  
- Develop a secure system for managing library resources.  
- Enable tracking of books, borrowers, and transactions digitally.  
- Provide features for reservations and reviews to enhance user experience.  
- Ensure a responsive and scalable application.  

#### 1.4 Feasibility Study  
Similar systems like "Library Management Software" [1] exist but often lack features like reviews or reservations. "Book Manager" leverages open-source tools (Node.js, MySQL), making it technically viable, operationally simple, and cost-effective for small libraries.  

#### 1.5 Gap Analysis  
Traditional library systems lack real-time tracking and user feedback mechanisms. "Book Manager" fills this gap with reservation management and review features, offering a more comprehensive solution.  

#### 1.6 Project Outcome  
The project delivers a functional library management tool that automates key tasks, improves accuracy, and provides a foundation for future enhancements like advanced UI and security features.  

---

### Chapter 2: Proposed Methodology  
This chapter outlines the design and planning of "Book Manager."  

#### 2.1 Requirement Analysis & Design  
The system requires a database to store relational data, a backend for processing, and a frontend for interaction. Security is ensured through authentication.  

#### 2.2 System Design & ER Diagram  
The architecture uses a client-server model:  
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript.  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.  
- **Database:** MySQL with tables like `Books`, `Borrowers`, and `Transactions`.  

**ER Diagram Description:**  
- **Entities:**  
  - `Users (user_id, username, email, password)`  
  - `Books (book_id, title, author_id, category_id, stock)`  
  - `Borrowers (borrower_id, name, email, phone, join_date)`  
  - `Transactions (transaction_id, book_id, borrower_id, borrow_date, return_date)`  
  - `Reservations (reservation_id, book_id, borrower_id, reserve_date, status)`  
  - `Reviews (review_id, book_id, borrower_id, rating)`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - `Books` → `Authors` (Many-to-One via `author_id`).  
  - `Transactions` → `Books` & `Borrowers` (Many-to-One via foreign keys).  
- **Diagram Note:** Visualize with boxes for entities and lines for relationships (to be drawn in Word).  

#### 2.3 UI Design  
The UI uses Tailwind CSS for responsiveness:  
- **Auth Page:** Login/signup forms.  
- **Dashboard:** Navigation to manage books, borrowers, etc.  
- **Tables:** Display data with "Add New" options.  
Future UI updates will refine forms and interactivity.  

#### 2.4 Project Plan  
- **Phase 1:** Database setup (Done).  
- **Phase 2:** Backend APIs (Done).  
- **Phase 3:** Frontend development (Done).  
- **Phase 4:** Testing (Ongoing).  
- **Phase 5:** UI enhancements (Future).

### Chapter 3: Implementation & Results  
This chapter details the development and evaluation of "Book Manager."  

#### 3.1 Development Process  
- **Tools:** VS Code, MySQL Workbench, Node.js, Git.  
- **Features:** Book/borrower management, transactions, reservations, reviews, authentication.  
- **Sample Code:**  
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Books (title, author_id, category_id, stock) VALUES ('1984', 2, 1, 3);
  ```  
  ```javascript
  app.get('/books', (req, res) => { db.query('SELECT * FROM Books', (err, results) => { res.json(results); }); });
  ```  

#### 3.2 System Performance  
- **Speed:** API responses in 100-300ms.  
- **Scalability:** Handles small datasets well; may need optimization for larger libraries.  
- **Stability:** Robust error handling in backend.  

#### 3.3 Outcome Analysis  
The system successfully manages library tasks with accurate data retrieval (e.g., books like "Harry Potter"). Authentication works, but security can be improved with hashing.

### Chapter 4: Engineering Standards  
This chapter evaluates the project’s broader impact and engineering alignment.  

#### 4.1 Societal & Environmental Impact  
- **Life:** Eases library management.  
- **Society & Environment:** Reduces paper use.  
- **Ethics:** Protects user data with authentication.  
- **Sustainability:** Open-source tools ensure longevity.  

#### 4.2 Team Collaboration  
- **Roles:** Database, backend, frontend split among team.  
- **Budget:** Minimal cost (open-source); no revenue model yet.  
- **Tools:** Git, regular sync-ups.  

#### 4.3 Complex Problem Mapping  
##### 4.3.1 Mapping of Program Outcome

### Instructions for Word File Update  
1. **Once You Share the Word File:**  
   - I’ll paste this content into your file, adjusting formatting to match your template (e.g., fonts, headings).  
   - I’ll add the ER Diagram as a text description under Section 2.2 (you can draw it using Word’s shapes or a tool like Draw.io).  

2. **ER Diagram Visualization Tip:**  
   - Use rectangles for entities (e.g., `Users`, `Books`), lines for relationships, and label foreign keys (e.g., `author_id` in `Books` links to `Authors`).
